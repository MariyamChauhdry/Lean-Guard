# Lean-Guard
LeanGuard is a lightweight computer vision-based object detection system designed to classify real-world items as either Prohibited or Safe. It aims to assist in monitoring environments (e.g., public spaces, institutions, schools, airports) where detecting harmful or unauthorized items such as weapons, alcohol, or sharp objects is crucial.
